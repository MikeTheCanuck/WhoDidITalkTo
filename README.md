# remember-who-I-talked-to
Who did I meet at that meetup last year?  Where did I see that person, and what did we talk about?

This will eventually help Mike answer the question, "Where did I meet you?" without looking like an ass by asking the person I'm talking to.

# React setup
Here's how I got my fresh-installed machine setup for working with React:
```
(installed homebrew for my Mac) /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install npm 
brew install git
cd timeline
npm install -g create-react-app
```

For you who fork or clone this repo, but already have experience with other GitHub projects, all you should need to do is:

```
cd timeline
npm install
```

I can't guarantee every step is necessary to run this app, but that sequence *did* make it possible for me, after a fresh OS X install.
