# Who Did I Talk To, aka "That F'n Guy"

You know that feeling at meetups where someone recognizes you, but you have no idea where from? What you must've talked about so extensively that they're referencing it?  All that?

Man, is it just me?

I got tired of disappointing people so often, so I created an application that presents me a timeline of all the new people I've met, where and when, their picture and what we talked about.  I can quickly skim the timeline to refresh myself on people I'm likely to bump into, so they get the same warm feeling of being recognized that I get when they recognize me.

# React setup
Here's how I got my fresh-installed machine setup for working with React:
```
(installed homebrew for my Mac) /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install npm 
brew install git
cd WhoDidITalkTo
npm install -g create-react-app
```

For you who fork or clone this repo, but already have experience with other GitHub projects, all you should need to do is:

```
cd WhoDidITalkTo
npm install
```

I can't guarantee every step is necessary to run this app, but that sequence *did* make it possible for me, after a fresh OS X install.
