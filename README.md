# remember-who-I-talked-to
Who did I meet at that meetup last year?  Where did I see that person, and what did we talk about?

This will eventually help Mike answer the question, "Where did I meet you?" without looking like an ass by asking the person I'm talking to.

# React setup
Here's the commands I ran to ensure I had met all the dependencies for the React prototype:
```
(I installed homebrew for my Mac) /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install npm 
brew install git
npm install -g create-react-app
npm install firebase
npm install timeline/package.json
npm install react-scripts
```

I can't guarantee this is all completely necessary to run this app, but that sequence *did* make it possible for me, after a fresh OS X install.
